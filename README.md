# Assignment 1: Predict diabetes via Perceptron

## Task

To implement, describe, and test a specific algorithm called Perceptron (which can be interpreted as a dense layer neural network) for predicting diabetes (using diabetes dataset provided). The submission will take the form of a conference paper.

## Data

The original data: https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database

The pre-processed data: https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvmtools/datasets/binary.html

# Assignment 2: Convolutional Neural Networks for CIFAR-10 multiclass image classification

## Task

To implement, describe, and test Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify images using CIFAR-10 dataset.
## Data

The well known CIFAR-10 dataset: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html

The data in this assignment is obtained by using pytorch built-in function torchvision.datasets.CIFAR10.
